# DL-Brain-Tumor-Classification-MRI--CNN-VGG16
- The Brain Tumor Classification MRI dataset is a medical image dataset designed for developing deep learning models to classify brain tumors using MRI scans. It is typically organized into two main directories: Training and Testing, each containing subfolders corresponding to four categoriesâ€”Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. These categories represent different types of brain tumors as well as healthy brain scans, allowing models to learn not only to detect tumors but also to distinguish between tumor types. The dataset provides a diverse set of MRI images that can be used to train and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate and automated brain tumor diagnosis. This classification task plays a vital role in supporting radiologists and improving early detection and treatment planning for patients with brain tumors.
- In this brain tumor classification project, explored both a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a transfer learning approach using the pre-trained VGG16 model on MRI images. The CNN model allowed us to design and understand the architecture from the ground up, while VGG16 leveraged deep feature representations learned from large-scale datasets to boost performance. Both models were trained using data augmentation and image preprocessing techniques to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. My experiment demonstrated that while the custom CNN performed well, the VGG16-based model achieved higher accuracy and robustness, showcasing the power of transfer learning in medical imaging tasks. With further enhancements and real-world data, such models have the potential to assist radiologists in the early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors
